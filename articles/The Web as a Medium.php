			<h3>The web as a creative medium</h3>

				<p>
					The web and the building blocks that it is formed of are very powerful and versatile media for creation. However, unlike traditional media used for creating, for example, a work of art, the web is composed of mostly nonphysical components. The primary physical component of the web is the Internet, the interconnected servers upon which it is stored and the computers which access it. The nonphysical web is the entire collection of data that is stored and accessed by users. As such, the web is constantly changing and expanding. The web is an inherently creative endeavor. Everything on the web has been created by users with a multitude of tools, from basic building blocks to complex special effects. 
					<br>
					<br>
					At its most basic, the web is formed of individual pages that contains text, images, videos, and software. Each page is located at a specific address, and a collection of related pages with linked addresses form a website. Web pages are like the paint and ink, and the web is the canvas upon which they are displayed. Web pages are formed of several separate components. The HTML language is used to create the basic content of the web page - the text, images, audio, and video. CSS is the component which organizes and styles the content to make it more presentable. Multiple programming languages are used to create software that controls the behavior of the page and the software or utilities that the web page offers. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Because everything on the web is created by individuals, it is a collaborative effort. Nothing is built from start to finish by one person. The programming languages used were built by others. The software used to create web content was built by others. Even the visual media used was often created by others. Teams of developers collaborate to create bring all the building blocks together into a cohesive, finished product. And web products are quickly displacing their real-world equivalents. A number of news sources and magazines have moved to web formats. More advertising is done on the web than in the form of posters and billboards. Many artists work solely digitally and have entire portfolios that only exist online. And there are vast storage spaces on the web to hold all of that media. There is vastly more storage space for web content than there would be to store their real-world equivalents in reality. A million copies of a digital magazine may sit on a flash drive the size of a stick of gum, but a million print magazines would take up a whole room. Even more importantly, only one copy of the digital magazine needs to exist. It can be copied a million times for free and be accessed by anyone in the world with an internet connection. Accessibility is perhaps the web’s greatest strength.
					<br>
					<br>
					The only limitations to accessing and creating web content are access to equipment and skill. Access to computers and to the Internet is already widespread as is constantly growing. And education in computer usage and in coding are becoming cheaper and, in a lot of cases, free. But as with any creative medium, practice and skill are important. Poorly designed and produced websites already proliferate on the web. Will that trend continue to grow along with access to education and equipment? It seems that web development has a large learning curve. It is difficult enough to learn how to use the individual components. But how do they function together to make an integrated whole? How much effort would it take an individual to learn enough to make a polished web page?  More and more platforms are trying to make it easier for the novice user to create web content, so what will the role of the web developer look like as tools for web creation become more user-friendly and less hands-on? Fortunately the web, as a medium for creation and expression, enables any individual to pick up the tools and produce something. As a medium which is consumed, the demands of the web’s user base will continue to shape its content and encourage continual improvement and progress. And skilled and practiced web developers will be the ones shaping that progress.
